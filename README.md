#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Objective
Privacle means private circle. Nowadays, tons of social media platforms make people’s lives nearly transparent. Sometimes we are just too shy to go to an event without knowing anybody in the event. It will be so much easier if you go to an event with friends.

This application is aimed to provide a solution for users who wants to create/search events within their friend circles so that each event will have similar background attendees and at least one friend going to the event. Unlike meetup, user will only be able to see a small amount of events either created by user or created by user’s friend.
Goals
Sometimes when user want to create a private party such as a birthday party, he/she may loves to meet new friends, but not totally stranger with totally different backgrounds. In this case, the goal of Privacle is to provide a platform for users to keep and maintain their friends in reality relationships, they can only make new friends in the actual events. This is a combination of virtual and reality.
Solution
After login, user can either find friends by their emails or create an events with details. The attendees will be listed under each event, however, user will only be able to see their friends in the attendees list.
